# Bachelor's Thesis - HCI 3D Interaction Research Project

This project contains the code and written dissertation pertaining to my bachelor's thesis, titled "Subconscious behavioral patterns and decision-making in three-dimensional virtual environments". The software project was created in the Unity cross-platform game engine, and consists of several 3D first-person environments, in the form of navigable mazes. These environments were leveraged in order to evaluate users' biases when traversing virtual spaces.

Please consult the related document or presentation for more detailed information on the experiment.
